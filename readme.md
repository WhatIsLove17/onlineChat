#Online Chat
___
This is my first online chat.
For convenience, the project is divided into modules:
- __client__ - a user module that is needed to connect to the server and send and output messages.
- __server__ - accepts messages from all connected client applications and sends them to others.
- __network__ - abstraction of connection between devices. Used by the server and the client.
